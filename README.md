# vanjsHelper README

This is my personal helper for writing **VanJS** and **Mini-Van** code. Specifically, it defines commands that are helpful for building the https://vanjs.org/ website.

This extension is only intended for my personal use, as the commands are very specific to my use cases. That said, I feel that open sourcing it might be helpful if it can inspire people to build similar extensions.

## Command Reference

* `Insert Child` (`vanjsHelper.insertChild`): Shortcut: `ctrl+8`. Inserts a new child node in the current tag.

* `Insert Link` (`vanjsHelper.insertLink`): Shortcut: `ctrl+7`. Inserts a `Link` component.

* `Insert Symbol` (`vanjsHelper.insertSymbol`): Shortcut: `ctrl+6`. Inserts a `Symbol` component.

* `vanjsHelper: Import Component` (`vanjsHelper.importComponent`): Add import for the component at the cursor defined in [`common.ts`](https://github.com/vanjs-org/vanjs-org.github.io/blob/master/sitegen/common.ts).
